            <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my web page. My offical legal name is Richard Paul Kazanowski Jr, but you can call me by my more widley used nickname RJ! </p>
    
            <p>My main interest and above all passion in this world.....is International Travel! As of Septmeber of 2019, I have visited by my count 78 countries in the world. Of those 78 countries, I have set foot on 6 of the 7 continents (however briefly) and have literally been to every single country in Europe. Yes, even the more remote countries on that continent, such as Belarus, San Marino, Transnistia, Sark, & Kosovo, among others.</p>

            <p>Roughly there are 195 countries in the world, while visiting them all one day might be a personal goal of mine, for the time being I'll be content with just cracking 100. Needless to say I have seen some incredible places, meet some facinating people, and have tried many unique foods.</p>

            <p>Another interest of mine is digital art, Always hating the mess and smell of traditional art mediums, I took to digital art around 2005 and since then it has been my most enduring hobby thus far!</p>
